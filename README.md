Random Journal Prompt (Ver. 2)

I felt I wouldn't be able to make something I liked until my understanding of CSS and JS got a little better but I kept chipping away at this for about a week. I'm finally 75% satisfied! I'd like to add more accessibility options and improve the CSS more, but for now I will love it and leave it~
