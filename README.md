Random Journal Prompt (Ver. 2)

I felt I wouldn't be able to make something I liked until my understanding of CSS and JS got a little better but I kept chipping away at this for about a week. I'm finally 75% satisfied! I'd like to add more accessibility options and improve the CSS more, but for now I will love it and leave it~

# What's changed?
>- Added a vent box
>- Added date and time
>- **More prompts**!
>- Improved layout
>- Added share buttons for social media
>- Fixed a time bug (displaying am instead of pm)
>- Attempted responsive mobile design

# random journal prompt (ver. 3)

This version is closer to my vision! However there's too many files to host it on github ðŸ¥²

# What's different?
>- Vent box works as intended
>- Added music and ambient sound buttons
>- Responsive design actually works now lol
>- Added light/dark mode
